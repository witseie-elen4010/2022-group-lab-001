# What went well

-   Functional MVP in which was acceptable

-   All 5 group members contributed. Each individual met their
    expectations

-   Helping each other out where needed: screen sharing, bouncing ideas.
    Helping with sections where one person had already succeeded.

# What could be improved

-   Independence of initial user stories: our initial user stories were
    not suitable for dividing up between team members because they were
    dependent on one another and so couldn't be easily done in parallel.

-   Acceptance tests could have been more clearly refined at the
    beginning of the sprint. The source of the issue here though was
    having to change the stories in the middle of the sprint due to
    dependencies. This resulted in the stories not being well defined
    enough

-   Estimation of individual tasks: underestimating how long tasks such
    as word generation

-   Front-end and back-end should be decoupled more. In some cases, we
    had to duplicate code so that it could be unit tested and be
    separate in the front end

-   Transparency of code: pushing regularly so we can see one another's
    branches

-   Time management: most pull-requests happened on the last day. This
    restricted the depth of review.

# Commit to improving for next sprint

-   Decide on better, clearer structure for repo. Research into Model
    View Controller (MVC) structure.

-   Separate concerns better. Use API requests to communicate between
    front end and back end

-   To improve time management and code review, we should have
    independent user-sized stories and separate them into smaller
    developer-sized stories. Each of us can perform a pull-request on
    one story earlier in the week to help us get detailed feedback.

# Sprint Velocity

Sprint velocity = 10 points/1 sprint = 10 points/sprint
