# What went well

Some helpful changes implemented that were improvements over last
sprint:

-   Stories were more independent. There was still some overlap, but it
    was better than last sprint.

-   Our output was substantially improved compared to sprint 1 (15 story
    points compared to 10 from the previous sprint). This was likely due
    to our being more familiar with JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

-   Better separation of concerns. MVC format allowed for a clearer repo
    structure and better testing.

-   Better testing was implemented.

-   Pull requests were made earlier which allowed more time for code
    review. This improved the detail of the reviews and gave us more
    time to implement changes as needed.

-   Significant increase in output

# What could be improved

-   Remote deployment should be done earlier (to a staging branch) to
    give time to ensure that it behaves in the same way as the local
    deployment. There is a bug that occasionally surfaces on the Azure
    version that does not show on the local one

-   Scope of stories should have been clearer. There were two
    potentially overlapping stories which caused confusion as to which
    person should implement the 'overlapping' functionality. This was
    resolved later in the sprint but took far longer than writing
    clearer acceptance tests from the beginning

# Commit to improving for next sprint

-   Write more detailed acceptance tests earlier in the sprint

-   Deploy to staging instance before deploying to live instance

# Sprint Velocity

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Sprint 1                            10 points
  ----------------------------------- -----------------------------------
  Sprint 2                            15 points

  **Average**                         **12.5 points/sprint**
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

In the next sprint we should aim for approximately 15 points as for part
of the sprint we will be focused on other assignments.
