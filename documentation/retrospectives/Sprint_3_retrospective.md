# What went well

-   Good collaboration: we spent a lot of time this week on Google Meets
    calls helping each other out with bugs

-   We had daily stand-ups which helped us have a clearer understanding
    of where everyone is and request assistance when needed.

-   Stories were more independent of one another and had clearer scopes.

-   Many of our stories were in earlier (at least a day before the end
    of the sprint). This also helped us have better engagement on Pull
    Requests and give one another more detailed feedback.

-   We deployed more regularly to Azure which meant we were able to
    check that features worked on the cloud.

-   We had a highly productive sprint despite time constraints due to
    other projects.

-   Each member managed to complete their stories to achieve the
    required functionality.

# What could be improved

-   Stand-ups were not as useful if we had not been working on the
    project the previous day. In such instances, it would be better to
    schedule the stand-up for the afternoon.

-   More thorough integration testing could be added: we had a bug where
    the underlying code was working but errors came in when it was
    coupled with the API. This would have been found far earlier if we
    had an integration test for that piece of functionality.

-   Our code directory structure is a bit messy, and we should have
    clearer names for files.

# Retrospective on the overall project

-   Our project would have benefitted from a clearer structure from the
    beginning. This was largely due to our inexperience with web
    development and JavaScript at the beginning of the project.

-   It was quite challenging to work in a team of 5 developers. It is
    more difficult to understand how to modify code that you've never
    written, and co-ordinating with 5 people is more complex than
    co-operating in a team of 2. But we are happy with how we approached
    this challenge: we had open lines of communication, stand-up
    meetings and many collaborative meetings to help one another out
    with bug fixes.

-   The time schedule for the project was very tight due to other course
    commitments. This made the project challenging, but we think our
    consistent communication about our schedules and availability
    allowed us to deliver a good product and follow a good process
    despite the time limitations. For example, we committed to having
    daily 8am stand-ups by default, but if a team member could not make
    that time we would change the meeting if they communicated 24 hours
    in advance.

-   Full stack development was very interesting. We learnt a lot about
    web development, databases (relational and non-relational) and best
    practices (style and review guides).

# Sprint Velocity

|     Sprint 1    |     10 points         |
|-----------------|-----------------------|
|     Sprint 2    |     15 points         |
|     Sprint 3    |     12 points         |
| **Average**     | 12.33   points/sprint |

The sprint velocity for sprint 3 was lower than planned due to our other
course commitments. However, we managed to prioritise so that we
achieved the core functionality with this sprint and deferred less
important optional functionality which were not as important to the user
experience.
