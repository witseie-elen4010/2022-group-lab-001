## Code Style Guide

The JavaScript Standard style guide module will be utilised.
CamelCase will be used for the naming convention.
Java Scriptâ€™s strict mode will be used.
Large functions will be avoided by implementing sub functions.
Capital letters will be used for global variables.  
Comments will be used to explain why something is being done and the code itself should clearly indicate what is being done.
