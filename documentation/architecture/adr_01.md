# NODE.JS, EXPRESS and AZURE

## Context

This web app will be run using Node.js, which is a back-end JavaScript runtime environment and executes code outside of the web server.
It will make use of the Node.js web app framework, Express.
It will be deployed using Microsfot Azure.

## Decision

These architectural structures are required by the project brief. It is advantaggeous that we all have experience with them. The routing and API can be handled by Node and Express. Node is deisgned for scalability, so it will be useful as the web app becomes large. Express makes handling routing relatively simple and if structured properly, is easily readable. Azure is also scalable and provides flexibility, as well as user-friendliness.

## Status

Accepted

## Consequences

These architectural decisions affect the entire outcomes of functionailty, presntation and compatibility. Nonetheless, these choices must be implemented as per the project brief.
